# MetaQuery
Queries which can be used in visual scripting in a frontend and translated to good old LINQ in a backend.

Warning : MetaQuery is currently in beta phase and its usage may change drastically until it is officially released.

The first goal of MetaQuery is to be able to build a complete WHERE clause. Future goals :
-OrderBy
-MetaQueryLanguage : SQL-like syntax for creating MetaQueries
-Support for EF Core

## Getting started

The expression parsing was based off of [Jeremy Likness' ExpressionGenerator](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/ExpressionGenerator).
